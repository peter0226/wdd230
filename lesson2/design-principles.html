            <p><strong>Description:</strong> 
                Visual Hierarchy is effectively employed on the <em>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' news page</em> to prioritize and guide user attention. 
                This is achieved by prominently featuring <strong>important headlines</strong> with larger fonts and <span style="font-style: italic;">eye-catching styles</span>, making them stand out. </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, <strong>relevant images</strong> are strategically placed <strong>alongside the headlines</strong>, providing visual cues and enhancing the overall appeal. 
                The news items are <strong>logically organized</strong>, allowing users to easily follow the order of importance or chronology.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <em>Brief but informative descriptions</em> accompany each news piece, offering additional context without overwhelming the reader. 
                Consistent font styles and the judicious use of whitespace further contribute to a clean and user-friendly layout, ensuring that visitors can quickly identify and explore the news articles that interest them most.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>Organization/Company: Disney+</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/es-419/home" target="_blank">Visit Website</a></p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Disney+ effectively applies <strong>Hick's Law</strong> in its user interface design to streamline the process of choosing movies and shows. By categorizing content into distinct sections such as <em>Disney</em>, <em>Pixar</em>, <em>Marvel</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, and <em>National Geographic</em>, the platform reduces decision complexity. Users are presented with clear, easily recognizable categories, each containing related content.
            </p><p>
                This logical organization simplifies the selection process, as viewers can quickly narrow down their choices based on their preferences. Whether someone is in the mood for a Disney classic, a Marvel superhero adventure, or a National Geographic documentary, <strong>the categorized sections help users find their desired content with minimal effort.</strong>
            </p><p>    
                Moreover, Disney+ <strong>optimizes the user experience by providing additional filtering options within each category</strong>, such as genre, release date, and popularity. These secondary choices further reduce the cognitive load, enabling users to make selections efficiently. In essence, Disney+ adheres to Hick's Law by presenting content in a structured and user-friendly manner, ultimately enhancing the platform's usability and viewer satisfaction.

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <p>Organization/Company: UVM</p>
            <p><a href="https://uvm.mx/" target="_blank">Visit Website</a></p>
            <img src="images/fittsLawExample.png" alt="Mobile Screenshot">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The <strong>Fitt's Law</strong> is skillfully utilized in the user interface of the UVM (Universidad del Valle de MÃ©xico) website. Specifically, the "Calculate Your Scholarship" button, a pivotal action for prospective students, is prominently featured as a sizable and <strong>easily clickable element</strong> on the scholarship information page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The decision to employ a large button adheres to Fitt's Law, which asserts that the time it takes to reach and click a target on a screen is inversely proportional to its size and proximity to the user's starting point. In this case, the "Calculate Your Scholarship"<strong>button's ample size</strong>  and its placement within easy reach streamline the user's interaction.
            </p>   
            <p>
                This deliberate design choice <strong> minimizes the potential for mis-taps or misclicks on less critical functions and decreases the cognitive effort required to determine scholarship eligibility</strong> . Prospective students can confidently and efficiently calculate their potential scholarships with a straightforward click, enhancing the overall user experience and facilitating their educational journey at UVM.
